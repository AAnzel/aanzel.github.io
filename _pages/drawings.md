> "Drawing is the honesty of the art. There is no possibility of cheating. It is either good or bad." -- Salvador Dali


I adore art in all its forms and shapes. In my spare time, I love to draw things that I find interesting and beautiful. The vast majority of the drawings and paintings below I created starting from _"The Great 2020 Quarantine"_.


The first image below will lead you to the collection of Pop Culture inspired works. The second image is a gateway to the collection of replicas of the Old Masters' artworks. The third image is a portal to the collection of works that are the products of my unwinding, eagerness to learn, and will to replicate things that I find gorgeous and/or interesting.
