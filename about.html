  <h2> <b>About</b></h2>

I am a PhD student and a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.uni-marburg.de/en">Philipps-Universität Marburg</a>, with the mentorship of <a href="http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146">Prof. Dr. Dominik Heider</a> and <a href = "https://ghattab.github.io/">Dr. Georges Hattab</a>. Currently, I am conducting research in the area of bioinformatics pipelines using machine learning, and various other data science methods. Besides that, I am also working on the problem of visualization of data stored in the organic, molecular form. More about the project I am working on can be found on <a href="https://mosla.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/gb/">the official project website</a>.

<br>
Previously, I graduated from <a href="http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/eng/">The Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade</a> with a Master's degree in Mathematics, module Computer Science and Informatics. I finished my Master's degree studies with an average grade of 10.00 (out of 10.00) and with my Master's Thesis <a href="https://github.com/AAnzel/Master_rad/blob/master/Master_rad.pdf"><i>'Determining protein N-glycosylation with machine learning methods'</i></a>.
