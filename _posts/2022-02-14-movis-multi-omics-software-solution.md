title: "MOVIS: A multi-omics software solution for multi-modal time-series clustering, embedding, and visualizing tasks"
excerpt: MOVIS is a modular, web-based tool for exploring time-series multi-omics data, designed to make complex temporal, multi-modal datasets accessible to researchers without deep computational expertise. It unifies different omics types for joint analysis and visualization, provides task-specific, reproducible, publication-ready graphics, and is openly available and easily extensible, including as an online service and containerized deployment.

Thanks to recent advances in sequencing and computational technologies, many researchers with biological and/or medical backgrounds are now producing multiple data sets with an embedded temporal dimension. Multi-modalities enable researchers to explore and investigate different biological and physico-chemical processes with various technologies. Motivated to explore multi-omics data and time-series multi-omics specifically, the exploration process has been hindered by the separation introduced by each omics-type. To effectively explore such temporal data sets, discover anomalies, find patterns, and better understand their intricacies, expertise in computer science and bioinformatics is required. Here we present MOVIS, a modular time-series multi-omics exploration tool with a user-friendly web interface that facilitates the data exploration of such data. It brings into equal participation each time-series omic-type for analysis and visualization. As of the time of writing, two time-series multi-omics data sets have been integrated and successfully reproduced. The resulting visualizations are task-specific, reproducible, and publication-ready. MOVIS is built on open-source software and is easily extendable to accommodate different analytical tasks. An online version of MOVIS is available under [https://movis.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/](https://movis.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/){:target="_blank"} and on Docker Hub ([https://hub.docker.com/r/aanzel/movis](https://hub.docker.com/r/aanzel/movis){:target="_blank"}).
