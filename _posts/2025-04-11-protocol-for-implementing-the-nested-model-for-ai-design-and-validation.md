Here, we present a protocol for implementing the nested model for developing and validating artificial intelligence (AI) systems in compliance with AI regulations. We describe steps for defining the regulations and associated ethical and technical key requirements through the potential research questions. We then detail the procedures for designing and validating an AI application across the domain, data, model, and prediction layers, enabling users to interact with layers through a front-end interface. For complete information on the generation and use of this protocol, please refer to Dubey _et al._ [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.110603](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.110603){:target="_blank"}.
