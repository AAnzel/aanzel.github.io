I am a Ph.D. student and a Research Associate at the [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en) under the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) and [Dr. habil. Georges Hattab](https://visualization.group/hattab/). Currently, I am conducting research in the area of bioinformatics pipelines and tools using machine learning and various other data science methods. Besides that, I am also working on the problems of designing, implementing, evaluating, and visualizing automatic workflows for information storage systems based on molecular storage media, _e.g._, DNA. More about the project I am working on can be found on [the official project website](https://mosla.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/gb/).

Previously, I was the Technical Lead at [eMedicals Healthtech GmbH](https://emedicals.de/) on _kidi_ platform project. There, I guided the development of all parts of the product in order to fight nutrition-sensitive diseases by applying food as medicine. Our first product was _kidiONE_ -- a publicly available nutrition app that helps people with nutrition-sensitive diseases track and regulate their dietary habits. Our second product was _kidiPRO_ -- a prescription-only medical app that helps patients avoid malnutrition, increases drug adherence, supports blood pressure management, and enables the monitoring of the disease by the patient and by the physician. _kidiPRO_ and _kidiDOC_ products were being developed as prescription medical applications (Software as a Medical Device) according to all relevant regulatory standards (BfArM, FDA, ISO, and IEC).

Furthermore, I graduated from the [Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade](http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/eng/), with a Master's degree in Mathematics, module Computer Science and Informatics. I finished my Master's degree studies with an average grade of 10.00 (out of 10.00) and with my Master's Thesis ['Determining protein N-glycosylation with machine learning methods'](https://github.com/AAnzel/Master_thesis/blob/master/Master_rad.pdf).
