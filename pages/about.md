I am a Ph.D. student and a Research Assistant at the [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en), under the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) and [Dr. Georges Hattab](https://ghattab.github.io/). Currently, I am conducting research in the area of bioinformatics pipelines using machine learning and various other data science methods. Besides that, I am also working on the problems of designing, implementing, evaluating, and visualizing automatic workflows for information storage systems based on the molecular storage media, _e.g._, DNA. More about the project I am working on can be found on [the official project website](https://mosla.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/gb/).

Furthermore, I am the Technical Lead at the [eMedicals Healthtech GmbH](https://emedicals.de/) on both kidiDNA and nephroDS projects. There, I try to guide and develop both products in order to fight nutrition-sensitive diseases by applying food as medicine. Our first product is kidiDNA (kidi Digital Nutritional Assistant) - a prescription-only medical app that avoids malnutrition, increases drug adherence, supports blood pressure management, and enables the monitoring of the disease by the patient and by the physician. Both products are being developed as prescription medical applications (Software as a Medical Device) according to all relevant regulatory standards (BfArM, FDA, ISO, and IEC).

Previously, I graduated from the [Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade](http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/eng/), with a Master's degree in Mathematics, module Computer Science and Informatics. I finished my Master's degree studies with an average grade of 10.00 (out of 10.00) and with my Master's Thesis ['Determining protein N-glycosylation with machine learning methods'](https://github.com/AAnzel/Master_thesis/blob/master/Master_rad.pdf).
