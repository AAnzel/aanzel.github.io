I am a Ph.D. student and a Research Assistant at the [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en), with the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) and [Dr. Georges Hattab](https://ghattab.github.io/). Currently, I am conducting research in the area of bioinformatics pipelines using machine learning and various other data science methods. Besides that, I am also working on the problem of visualization of data stored in the organic, molecular form. More about the project I am working on can be found on [the official project website](https://mosla.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/gb/).</small>

Previously, I graduated from the [Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade](http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/eng/), with a Master's degree in Mathematics, module Computer Science and Informatics. I finished my Master's degree studies with an average grade of 10.00 (out of 10.00) and with my Master's Thesis ['Determining protein N-glycosylation with machine learning methods'](https://github.com/AAnzel/Master_thesis/blob/master/Master_rad.pdf).</small>
