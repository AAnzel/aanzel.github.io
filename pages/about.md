I am a Research Associate at the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) as part of the research group led by [Dr. habil. Georges Hattab](https://visualization.group/hattab/). There, I have the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research and development initiatives at the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, visualization, and public health. As part of a diverse team of researchers, we collaborate to create innovative methods for visualizing and interpreting AI models in public health scenarios. Additionally, my focus is on enhancing existing visualization techniques utilized in AI models within the public health domain. This involved conducting in-depth analysis and evaluation, as well as proposing novel solutions to improve user comprehension and foster trust in AI systems.

Moreover, I am a Ph.D. candidate and at the [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en) under the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) and [Dr. habil. Georges Hattab](https://visualization.group/hattab/). Currently, I am conducting research in the area of bioinformatics pipelines and tools using machine learning and various other data science methods. Besides that, I am also working on the problems of designing, implementing, evaluating, and visualizing automatic workflows for information storage systems based on molecular storage media, _e.g._, DNA. More about the project I am working on can be found on [the official project website](https://mosla.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/gb/).

Previously, I was the Technical Lead at [eMedicals Healthtech GmbH](https://emedicals.de/) on _kidi_ platform project. There, I guided the development of all parts of the product in order to fight nutrition-sensitive diseases by applying food as medicine. Our first product was _kidiONE_ -- a publicly available nutrition app that helps people with nutrition-sensitive diseases track and regulate their dietary habits. Our second product was _kidiPRO_ -- a prescription-only medical app that helps patients avoid malnutrition, increases drug adherence, supports blood pressure management, and enables the monitoring of the disease by the patient and by the physician. _kidiPRO_ and _kidiDOC_ products were being developed as prescription medical applications (Software as a Medical Device) according to all relevant regulatory standards (BfArM, FDA, ISO, and IEC).

Furthermore, I graduated from the [Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade](http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/eng/), with a Master's degree in Mathematics, module Computer Science and Informatics. I finished my Master's degree studies with an average grade of 10.00 (out of 10.00) and with my Master's Thesis ['Determining protein N-glycosylation with machine learning methods'](http://elibrary.matf.bg.ac.rs/handle/123456789/5013?show=full).
