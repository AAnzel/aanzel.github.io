I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) as part of the research group led by [PD Dr. habil. Georges Hattab](https://visualization.group/hattab/). There, I have the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research and development initiatives at the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, visualization, and public health. As part of a diverse team of researchers, we collaborate to create innovative methods for visualizing and interpreting AI models in public health scenarios. Additionally, my focus is on enhancing existing visualization techniques utilized in AI models within the public health domain. This involves conducting in-depth analysis and evaluation, as well as proposing novel solutions to improve user comprehension and foster trust in AI systems.


Moreover, I successfully completed my Ph.D. journey under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) and [PD Dr. habil. Georges Hattab](https://visualization.group/hattab/) as a Ph.D. candidate and Research Associate at the [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en). During my doctoral studies, I conducted research focused on bioinformatics pipelines and tools, utilizing machine learning and various data science techniques. Additionally, I devoted my efforts to addressing the challenges associated with the development, implementation, evaluation, and visualization of automated workflows for information storage systems using molecular storage media, such as DNA. Detailed information about the project I contributed to can be found on the official project website. The culmination of my Ph.D. experience, along with notable research achievements, is documented in my Doctoral Dissertation titled ["A Tale of Two Approaches: Comparing Top-Down and Bottom-Up Strategies for Analyzing and Visualizing High-Dimensional Data"](https://doi.org/10.17192/z2023.0533).


Previously, I was the Technical Lead at [eMedicals Healthtech GmbH](https://emedicals.de/) on _kidi_ platform project. There, I guided the development of all parts of the product in order to fight nutrition-sensitive diseases by applying food as medicine. Our first product was _kidiONE_ -- a publicly available nutrition app that helps people with nutrition-sensitive diseases track and regulate their dietary habits. Our second product was _kidiPRO_ -- a prescription-only medical app that helps patients avoid malnutrition, increases drug adherence, supports blood pressure management, and enables the monitoring of the disease by the patient and by the physician. _kidiPRO_ and _kidiDOC_ products were being developed as prescription medical applications (Software as a Medical Device) according to all relevant regulatory standards (BfArM, FDA, ISO, and IEC).

Furthermore, I graduated from the [Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade](http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/eng/), with a Master's degree in Mathematics, module Computer Science and Informatics. I finished my Master's degree studies with an average grade of 10.00 (out of 10.00) and with my Master's Thesis ["Determining protein N-glycosylation with machine learning methods"](http://elibrary.matf.bg.ac.rs/handle/123456789/5013?show=full).
