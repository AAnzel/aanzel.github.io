> 'Drawing is the honesty of the art. There is no possibility of cheating. It is either good or bad.' â€• Salvador Dali


I adore art in all its forms and shapes. In my spare time, I love to draw things that I find interesting and beautiful. The vast majority of the drawings below I created starting from The Great 2020 Quarantine.


The first image below will lead you to the collection of Pop Culture inspired drawings. The second image is a gateway to the collection of replicas of the Old Masters' artworks. The third image is a portal to the collection of drawings that are the products of my unwinding, eagerness to learn, and will to replicate things that I find gorgeous and/or interesting.
